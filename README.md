Bug with @apollo/client and InMemoryCache's restore()

### Intended outcome

`new InMemoryCache().restore(window.apolloState || {})` should populate the cache from `window.apolloState`. It works with `apollo-client` (version 2.6.x), but not with `@apollo/client`.

### Actual outcome

`new InMemoryCache().restore(window.apolloState || {})` doesn't populate the cache, it's empty.

### How to reproduce

You can comment and uncomment the lines with ðŸ•· and âœ… and clearly see how it works with old version 2.6.x and doesn't work with the 3.x.

    import { ApolloClient } from '@apollo/client' // ðŸ•· It doesn't work with @apollo-client
    import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client' // ðŸ•· same here

    // import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client' // âœ… But it works with apollo-client v2.6.x
    // import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory' // âœ… and apollo-cache-inmemory

### Installation

    npm install
    npm run client
    npm run server
    npm start
